Estimating Sthe proportion of spurious alignments in ancient DNA as escribed in de Filippo, Meyer and Pr√ºfer, "Quantifying and reducing spurious alignments for the analysis of ultra-short ancient DNA sequences" 2018 BMC Biology 2018 16:121.

Although the method is applied directly to hominin DNA, it works with any spiecies as long as there is a close reference genome and some data of the variation within spieces.

For the time being have a look at the following link for a full description of the procedure https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/SpAl/
